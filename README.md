1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
   No I wouldn't just use unit testing. This is because even though it would be quicker and easier to test the different section of this messaging applicaiton the unit test has downsides. Mostly it does NOT test how these componenets interact with each other. I would think that a message app has many different moving parts where just unit testing is not sufficientn to properly test the functionality of the messaging app.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
   Yes I would. Since unit testing is quick and tests on a small scale this would be a good case to use unit testing. There is no interaction with this max message length function and other parts so this avoids the main downside of unit testing.
